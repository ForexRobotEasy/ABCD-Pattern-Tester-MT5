ABCD Pattern Tester MT5 is a MetaTrader 5 (MT5) expert advisor that scans the forex market for the ABCD pattern and provides trading signals based on this pattern. This code serves as a sample implementation of the ABCD pattern tester logic.

## Global Variables

- `symbols`: An array to store the list of symbols to be tested.
- `timeframes`: An array to store the list of timeframes to be tested.
- `totalSymbols`: The total number of symbols in the `symbols` array.
- `totalTimeframes`: The total number of timeframes in the `timeframes` array.

## Initialization Function

The `OnInit()` function is responsible for initializing the symbols and timeframes. It retrieves the list of symbols available in the market and sets the predefined timeframes to be tested. It also calculates the total number of symbols and timeframes.

## Main Execution Function

The `OnTick()` function is the main execution function that is called on every tick. It loops through all symbols and timeframes and applies the ABCD pattern tester logic for each combination. After testing, it prints the results indicating whether the ABCD pattern was found on the current symbol and timeframe.

## Deinitialization Function

The `OnDeinit()` function is called when the expert advisor is being shut down. It performs any necessary cleanup and deinitialization procedures.

## Additional Functions

Additional functions can be added to aid in ABCD pattern testing, trading, and error handling. These functions should be implemented separately to provide the desired functionality.
